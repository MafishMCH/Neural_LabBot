# Neural_LabBot
Neural Network for autonomous collision avoidance in the lab.

1. Photos used to train the network are in labbot_uczenie_zdjecia_scaled_down folder.
2. Dataset was gathered using uczenie_labbot.py script.
3. To make and train the network, script under NET/train_v6.py was used. 
4. Network itself is saved in model files in NET/model.json and NET/model.h5
5. To run the network NET/robot_node.py is used.
